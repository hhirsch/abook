Git:
  * support for mouse
  * scrolling now affects the viewport instead of the cursor
  * support for a colored UI
  * added "groups" as a default field
  * the UI now support merging selected entries [key M]
    and removing duplicates [key U]
  * a "custom" output filter allow the specification of an output
    format using placeholders
  * search-next is now bound to "/" too
  * some output filters can now be used in the context
    of --mutt-query. This is the case of "vcard" and "custom"
    [ no --query option has been created and --mutt-query is fully
      backward compatible ]
  * ldif output filter has been fixed [output modified] in multiple
    ways, does not force output to latin1 anymore and support input
    from stdin.
  * vcard input/output support:
    An original input filter implementation was provided soon
       after 0.6.0pre2.
    In 2012, an optional build-time option to link against libvformat
    was added for the very same task: parsing vcard.
    - It depends on the --enable-vformat ./configure switch
    - It's only used as an input filter, especially useful to
      deal with multi-valued fields and encoded characters.
  * when the UI requests a confirmation from the user before a
    destructive operation it does not treat unknown key as yes anymore.
  * allcsv output changes:
    - header line uses lowercase
    - "MOBILEPHONE" column name changed to "mobile" (consistent w.r.t. standard_fields)
    - now outputs defined custom fields as well

0.6.0pre2 (2010-07-22):
  * Added anniversary as a default field
  * Display dates according to current locale
  * The four following configuration options have been deprecated and will
    no longer be accepted by abook:
      * emailpos
      * extra_column
      * extra_alternative
      * extrapos

    They have been replaced with a single more flexible option:
    index_format.

    This option is a string defining the format of a line in the main list.
    It allows displaying of as many fields as desired, with optional
    width limit, as well as an arbitrary number of alternative fields.

0.6.0pre1 (2006-08-30):
  * The 'customfield' command has been obsoleted by a more flexible set
    of commands: 'field' and 'view'.

    Those two commands make it possible to define fields and organize
    them within tabs as you see fit.

    Not using these commands, the look and feel of previous releases
    will mostly be kept the same. Also see the related 'preserve_fields'
    configuration variable.
