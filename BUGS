known bugs in abook

* with certain terminals keyboard may not behave as expected - this is probably
  a ncurses problem
* incompatible with some terminals
  - there seems to be problems with some (old?) gnome-terminal versions -
    gnome-terminal bug?
* some keys may cause readline to crash - this is a readline (4.3) problem
  - there is a fix available for readline:
    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-4.3-patches/readline43-001

* cursor disappears in some cases with abook_readline() on Solaris. If
  you have problems it is recommended to use the ncurses library

* terminal state is not restored correctly on exit with certain ncurses and
  readline combination (more information is needed on this)

* file format is not tolerant for character set changes

name=Lastname, Firstname
email="Lastname, Firstname" <firstname.lastname@example.com>

but the command "abook --mutt-query lastname" returns two email addresses

"Lastname       Lastname, Firstname
Firstname" <firstname.lastname@example.com>     Lastname, Firstname

In other words, the mutt-query doesn't treat the comma as protected by the
quotes, although the conversion from pine format did.

Filters:
* mutt / elm / pine export filters allow to create a file with duplicate
  aliases

* mutt import filter imports only first e-mail address

* fseek in ldif import filter should be eliminated
